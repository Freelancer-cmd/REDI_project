# Educational Analytics Demo with OpenAI Tools & MCP

A TypeScript project demonstrating how to build an interactive educational analytics assistant using OpenAI tool calling and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate into its directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd openai-tools-and-mcp-examples
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and set your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Running the Demos

### Interactive Educational Analytics Demo

This will automatically start the MCP server and launch an interactive prompt:

```bash
npm run client
```

Ask questions about student and school performance (type `quit` to exit).

### Predefined Examples

Run a series of predefined analytics queries:

```bash
npm run client-demo
```

### Advanced Usage

- **Run built client/server:**
  ```bash
  npm run server      # Build and run MCP server
  npm run client      # Build and run interactive client
  ```

## Evaluation

To automatically generate and evaluate prompt responses for each MCP tool:

```bash
# In one terminal, start the MCP server:
npm run server

# In another terminal, run the evaluation script:
npm run evaluate
```

This will:

1. Generate 50 diverse prompts per registered tool (valid, invalid, and incomplete questions).
2. Send each prompt to the MCP server via the client and record userâ€“assistant conversations.
3. Use the Python `LLM_as_judge.py` script to assess responses with the LLM and save results to `evaluation/evaluations.json`.

## How It Works

### MCP Server (`src/mcp-server.ts`)

- Sets up the MCP server and registers analysis tools defined in `src/tools/`:
  - `analyze-student-performance`
  - `compare-domain-performance`
  - `identify-struggling-students`
  - `get-school-overview`
  - `get-exam-percentile`

### MCP Client (`src/mcp-client.ts`) & Example Conversation (`src/example-conversation.ts`)

- Discovers tools from the MCP server and converts them to OpenAI function definitions.
- Sends user queries to OpenAI, automatically executes any tool calls, and returns the final analysis.

The example conversation script provides both an interactive REPL and a predefined examples mode.
